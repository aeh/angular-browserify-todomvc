AngularJS/Browserify TodoMVC
============================

This is a copy of the AngularJS TodoMVC example (https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/architecture-examples/angularjs) with the following changes...

* Use node style require calls with Browserify
* Use Napa (https://github.com/shama/napa) to install Bower components with npm install
* Test cases working through protractor with the Mocha framework
* Build with Gulp

Still to do...

* Get it to build and run on Heroku
* Test with Travis CI / SauceLabs
